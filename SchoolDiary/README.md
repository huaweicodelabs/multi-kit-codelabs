## Introduction :

School Diary app will give you an insight about the Serverless components from Huawei Ecosystem such as Cloud Storage, Cloud DB. Apart from that you will also get an idea about Auth - Service that can be used to login to the application. The teacher and student mapping process which is an important feature, on the app. This process involves the QR code scanning and the save user profile, mapping details on the database.

## What You Will Create

In this code lab, you will create a School Diary project and use the APIs of HUAWEI Auth - Service, Scan Kit, Cloud DB, Cloud Storage. We are going to create a end to end Task diary application for two type of users who are Teacher and Student. A teacher could be create & assign, vallidate and close the task. A student can view and submit task by upload images of their work.

*  Login with Auth - Service
*  Scan QR and map the student with teacher
*  Teacher user - Create & assign, validate and Close the tasks with Cloud DB operations
*  Student user - Upload the task images in Cloud Storage and update to Cloud DB
