## Introduction :

UrbanHomeServices App will give insight about how Huawei's AGC Cloud DB service can be used by Service Providers to add services like Plumbing, Appliance Repair, Painting, Carpentry and House Keeping. So that, Consumer can query and avail those services based on their current location.
This app will also give insight about how HMS Identity kit will be used for user's address management like adding, editing and deleting addresses.

## What You Will Create

In this UrbanHomeServices Demo codelab, we are going to create a end to end prototype for adding, editing and deleting services from Cloud DB and query for those service based on user's address updated using HMS Identity kit.
Also, search for nearby stores using the HMS Site kit and show the route on the map using HMS Location and Map kit.

This application will be used by 2 kinds of Users.
*	Service Provider
*	Consumer

Service Provider:

*	Login using Huawei Id or Facebook Id.
*	Add, Update and Delete service details in the Cloud DB.

Consumer :
 
*	Login using Huawei Id or Facebook Id.
*	Querying for Service Providers like Plumbers, Electricians, Painters, Carpenters and House keeping.
*	Add, Update and Delete address.
*	Search for nearby stores and view the route to the store location on the map.
