# Healthy Cycling

## Introduction

Healthy Cycling is the mix of bike rental and exercise application which you can perform bike rental operations and see your weekly progress with some data like total distance, calorie.
The user displays the available bicycles on the map and can initiate rental by scanning QR code. If the user visits an area that we have determined with the Geofence feature while riding a bicycle, he/she will receive a surprise discount for the next ride and will be informed via App Messaging. When the user completes his/her riding with the location listening process, which is completely in the background, he/she can pay the fee determined according to the time and see the route he/she is traveling on the map. At the same time, this ride is recorded in the Huawei Health Application as an exercise with the Health Kit. Also, the user can track the total calories, total distance, duration, number of rides and average speed data in the weekly progress page of the application.
